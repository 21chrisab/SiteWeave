-- Fix RLS Policies for Organization Isolation
-- This script adds organization_id checks to all policies to prevent cross-organization data access
-- CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Users were seeing projects from other organizations!

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: ADD HELPER FUNCTION FOR ORGANIZATION ID
-- ============================================================================

-- Get the organization_id of the currently logged-in user
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_organization_id()
RETURNS UUID AS $$
  SELECT organization_id FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
$$ LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER STABLE;

-- Update get_user_role to work with both old TEXT role and new role_id system
-- Returns the role name, checking role_id first, then falling back to TEXT role field
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_role()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT COALESCE(
    -- Try new role_id system first
    (SELECT r.name 
     FROM public.profiles p
     LEFT JOIN public.roles r ON p.role_id = r.id
     WHERE p.id = auth.uid()),
    -- Fallback to old TEXT role field
    (SELECT role::TEXT 
     FROM public.profiles 
     WHERE id = auth.uid())
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER STABLE;

-- Helper to check if user is admin (checks both is_super_admin flag and role name)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_user_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
  SELECT COALESCE(
    (SELECT is_super_admin FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()),
    false
  ) OR get_user_role() = 'Admin';
$$ LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER STABLE;

-- Helper to check if user has a specific permission
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION user_has_permission(permission_name TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
  SELECT COALESCE(
    (r.permissions->permission_name)::boolean,
    false
  )
  FROM public.profiles p
  LEFT JOIN public.roles r ON p.role_id = r.id
  WHERE p.id = auth.uid();
$$ LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER STABLE;

-- Test query to check if policies are working:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects; -- Should only show projects in your org

COMMENT ON FUNCTION get_user_organization_id() IS 'Returns the organization_id of the current user. Used by RLS policies for multi-tenant isolation.';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION get_user_role() IS 'Returns the role name of the current user. Handles both old TEXT role field and new role_id system.';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION is_user_admin() IS 'Returns true if the current user is an admin. Checks both is_super_admin flag and role name.';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION user_has_permission(TEXT) IS 'Checks if the current user has a specific permission in their role.';

-- Migration complete!
-- Users will now only see projects, contacts, and other data from their own organization.
