## Architecture Highlights

### Database Schema
- **3 new tables:** organizations, roles, project_collaborators
- **20+ tables updated:** Added organization_id to all data tables
- **6 helper functions:** Organization and permission checks
- **99 RLS policies:** Comprehensive data isolation and access control
- **25+ indexes:** Optimized for multi-tenant queries

### Security Model
```

│         Row Level Security (RLS)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Organization Isolation               │
│    - All queries filtered by org_id     │
│    - Users can't see other org data     │
│                                          │
│ 2. Guest Access                         │
│    - Project collaborators bypass org   │

│                                          │
│ 4. Storage Security                     │
│    - Bucket policies respect org/guest  │
│    - Path-based access control          │

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Optional Enhancements (Not Critical for MVP)

1. **Explicit organization_id Filters**
   - Status: Optional (RLS handles this automatically)
   - Benefit: Defense in depth, code clarity
   - Effort: Low (add `.eq('organization_id', orgId)` to queries)

2. **Permission Guards on All Buttons**
   - Status: Optional (permissions enforced at API level)
   - Benefit: Better UX (hide buttons user can't use)
   - Effort: Medium (wrap buttons with `<PermissionGuard>`)

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Benefit: Track who did what and when
   - Effort: Medium (add audit_log entries on key actions)

4. **Organization Settings**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Benefit: Customize org behavior (branding, defaults)
   - Effort: Medium (new table + UI)

5. **Billing & Subscription Management**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Benefit: Monetization
   - Effort: High (integrate Stripe, usage tracking)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
✅ Indexes created on:
- `organization_id` on all data tables
- `role_id` on profiles
- `project_id` on project_collaborators
- `user_id` on project_collaborators

### Query Optimization
- RLS policies use indexed columns
- Helper functions use efficient queries
- JSONB permissions indexed with GIN index

### Scalability
- **Small orgs (< 100 users):** No issues
- **Medium orgs (100-1000 users):** Monitor query performance
- **Large orgs (> 1000 users):** Consider sharding or partitioning

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Database query performance (pg_stat_statements)
- Storage usage per organization
- User activity per organization
- RLS policy performance

### Maintenance Tasks
- Clean up expired invitations (monthly)
- Archive old projects (quarterly)
- Review and optimize slow queries (as needed)
- Update demo account data (as needed)

### Common Issues
See `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE-B2B.md` for troubleshooting guide.
