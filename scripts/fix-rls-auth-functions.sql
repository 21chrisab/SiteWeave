-- Fix RLS Policy Performance: Wrap Auth Functions in (select ...)
-- ============================================================================
-- This script fixes RLS policies to prevent per-row re-evaluation of auth functions
-- Pattern: auth.uid() → (select auth.uid())
-- Pattern: get_user_organization_id() → (select get_user_organization_id())
-- Pattern: get_user_role() → (select get_user_role())
-- Pattern: get_user_contact_id() → (select get_user_contact_id())
-- Pattern: get_user_email() → (select get_user_email())
-- Pattern: is_user_admin() → (select is_user_admin())
--
-- Note: Helper functions are already marked as STABLE, but wrapping in (select ...)
-- provides explicit optimization guarantee in RLS context and satisfies Supabase linter
