# Dynamic Workflow Field Issues System

A powerful, flexible field issues management system that allows Project Managers to create custom workflows for each issue. This replaces the rigid 5-step workflow with a dynamic, customizable workflow builder.

## üéØ Key Features

### **Dynamic Workflow Builder**
- **Custom Workflows**: PMs create unique workflows for each issue
- **Flexible Steps**: Add as many or as few steps as needed
- **Role Assignment**: Assign each step to specific team members
- **Visual Progress**: Real-time workflow progression tracking

### **Issue Management**
- **Issue Cards**: Display all active issues with custom workflows
- **Priority Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low with color coding
- **Due Dates**: Track issue deadlines and urgency
- **Status Tracking**: Open, Closed, Cancelled states

### **Workflow Orchestration**
- **Automatic Handoffs**: Workflows advance automatically when steps complete
- **Real-time Notifications**: Team members get instant updates
- **File Attachments**: Upload files at any step
- **Comment System**: Track progress and communication

## üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture

### **Two-Table Design**

#### **project_issues** (Parent Table)
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- project_id (Links to projects)
- title (Issue title)
- description (Issue description)
- status (open, closed, cancelled)
- current_step_id (Active step reference)
- priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- created_at, updated_at, due_date, resolved_at
- created_by_user_id
```

#### **issue_steps** (Child Table)
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- issue_id (Links to project_issues)
- step_order (1, 2, 3... sequence)
- description (Task description)
- assigned_to_user_id (User UUID)
- assigned_to_name (Display name)
- assigned_to_role (Role title)
- status (pending, in_progress, completed, skipped)
- completed_at, completed_by_user_id
- notes, created_at, updated_at
```

### **Supporting Tables**
- **issue_files**: File attachments with step linking
- **issue_comments**: Comments and step change history

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
```sql
-- Run the new schema
\i create_dynamic_workflow_issues.sql

-- Insert sample data
\i dynamic_workflow_sample_data.sql
```

### 2. Component Integration
The component is already integrated into `ProjectDetailsView.jsx` and will appear between Tasks and Files sections.

## üíº Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Soil Conflict Issue**
**PM creates a 3-step workflow:**
1. **Step 1**: "Survey new elevation at B-4" ‚Üí Assign to: Sarah Johnson (Surveyor)
2. **Step 2**: "Re-estimate earthwork costs" ‚Üí Assign to: David Wilson (Estimator)  
3. **Step 3**: "Submit change order to client" ‚Üí Assign to: Mike Chen (PM)

**Workflow in Action:**
- Surveyor gets notification: "Survey new elevation at B-4"
- Surveyor completes task, uploads topo file, clicks "Mark Step Complete"
- System automatically advances to Step 2
- Estimator gets notification: "Re-estimate earthwork costs"
- Process continues until all steps complete

### **Example 2: Foundation Crack Assessment**
**PM creates a 4-step workflow:**
1. **Step 1**: "Conduct structural assessment" ‚Üí Assign to: Sarah Johnson (Surveyor)
2. **Step 2**: "Consult with structural engineer" ‚Üí Assign to: Dr. Emily Rodriguez (Engineer)
3. **Step 3**: "Prepare repair plan and estimate" ‚Üí Assign to: David Wilson (Estimator)
4. **Step 4**: "Present findings to client" ‚Üí Assign to: Mike Chen (PM)

### **Example 3: Material Delivery Delay**
**PM creates a 2-step workflow:**
1. **Step 1**: "Contact alternative suppliers" ‚Üí Assign to: Jennifer Lee (Procurement)
2. **Step 2**: "Update construction schedule" ‚Üí Assign to: Mike Chen (PM)

## üé® User Interface

### **Create Issue Modal**
When PM clicks "Create Issue," they see:

#### **Part 1: Issue Details**
- Issue Title: "Soil conflict in Sector C"
- Description: "Hit unexpected rock shelf at grid line B-4..."
- Priority: Dropdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Due Date: Date picker

#### **Part 2: Workflow Builder**
- **Step 1**: [Text Input: "Enter task description..."] [Assign to: "Name, Role, User ID"]
- **+ Add Step** button to add more steps
- **Remove Step** button (if more than 1 step)
- **Reorder Steps** automatically

### **Issue Display**
- **Issue Cards**: Show title, description, priority, progress
- **Workflow Tracker**: Visual progress bar with step numbers
- **Current Step**: Highlighted in blue
- **Completed Steps**: Green checkmarks
- **Expandable**: Click to see action panel

### **Action Panels**
- **Assigned Users**: See action buttons and file upload
- **Other Users**: See read-only status information
- **File Upload**: Upload supporting documents
- **Step Completion**: Mark step complete to advance workflow

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### **Workflow Progression Logic**
```sql
-- When a step is completed, trigger automatically:
1. Mark current step as 'completed'
2. Find next step (step_order + 1)
3. Update project_issues.current_step_id
4. If no more steps, mark issue as 'closed'
```

### **Real-time Updates**
- Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Automatic UI refresh after actions
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Progress tracking updates

### **File Management**
- Supabase Storage integration
- File type detection and categorization
- Step-specific file linking
- Upload progress indicators

## üîß Customization Options
