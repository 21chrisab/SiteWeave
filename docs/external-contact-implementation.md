# External Contact Assignment System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the two-phase external contact assignment system for SiteWeave, which enables Project Managers to assign tasks to contacts who don't have SiteWeave accounts.

## Implementation Date
**Completed**: October 23, 2025

---

## Phase 1: External Contact Fix (Immediate Solution)

### ✅ Status: COMPLETE

Phase 1 enables PMs to assign tasks to external contacts and automatically send email notifications with task details.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `schema.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `email TEXT` column to `contacts` table
  - Added `phone TEXT` column to `contacts` table
  - Added index on `email` for performance (`idx_contacts_email`)

#### 2. Email Notification System
- **File**: `src/utils/emailNotifications.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `sendTaskAssignmentEmail()` - Sends beautiful HTML email notifications

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: PM Assigns Task to External Contact (Email Only)

1. PM adds contact with email address in Contacts page
2. PM creates a new issue in ProjectDetailsView
3. PM assigns a step to the contact with email
4. System automatically sends email notification
5. Contact receives email with task details
6. Contact replies to PM via email with updates
7. PM manually updates the task status

**User Experience**:
- ✅ PM can manage entire workflow in SiteWeave
- ✅ External contact doesn't need account
- ✅ Communication happens via email
- ✅ PM closes loop by updating status

### Workflow 2: PM Invites Contact to Sign Up

1. PM tries to assign task to email not in system (future feature)
2. System prompts: "Invite [email] to join?"
3. PM confirms invitation
4. System creates invitation and sends email
5. Contact receives invitation email with signup link
6. Contact clicks link, lands on AcceptInvitationView
7. Contact signs up with same email
8. System automatically:
   - Creates contact record
   - Adds to project
   - Assigns to task
   - Marks invitation accepted
9. Contact redirected to project page
10. Contact can now access full SiteWeave features

**User Experience**:
- ✅ Seamless signup flow
- ✅ No manual project/task linking needed
- ✅ Instant access to assigned work
- ✅ Full app functionality unlocked

```
SiteWeave App
    ↓
Supabase Edge Function (send-email / send-invitation-email)
    ↓
Resend API
    ↓
SMTP Delivery
    ↓
Contact's Inbox
```

### Invitation Flow Architecture

```
PM creates invitation
    ↓
invitations table (status: pending)
    ↓
Edge function sends email
    ↓
Contact clicks link (/invite/:token)
    ↓
AcceptInvitationView loads
    ↓
Contact signs up
    ↓
acceptInvitation() processes:
    - Create contact
    - Link to profile

    - Mark invitation accepted
    ↓
Redirect to project
```

### Database Relationships

```
auth.users (1) ←→ (1) profiles ←→ (0..1) contacts
                                      ↓
                                      ↓ (many)
                          project_contacts (junction table)
                                      ↓
                                      ↓ (many)

- All queries use indexed columns
- RLS policies are optimized

### Edge Functions
- Cold start: ~100-200ms
- Warm: ~20-50ms
- Resend API latency: ~100-300ms
- Total: ~200-500ms per email

### Bundle Size
- New utilities: ~15 KB
- New components: ~25 KB
- Total added: ~40 KB (minified)

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Logs to Check
```bash
# Email sending logs
supabase functions logs send-email --follow

# Invitation logs
supabase functions logs send-invitation-email --follow

# Database queries
# Check slow_queries in Supabase Dashboard
```

### Database Queries for Monitoring
```sql
-- Check pending invitations
SELECT * FROM invitations WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Check expired invitations
SELECT * FROM invitations 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND expires_at < NOW();

-- Check acceptance rate
SELECT 
  status, 
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM invitations
GROUP BY status;
```

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Emails not sending
- Check Resend API key is set
- Verify domain is verified
- Check edge function logs
- Test with curl command

**Issue**: Invitations not working
- Verify RLS policies are active
- Check invitation token in database
- Ensure email matches exactly
- Check expiration date

**Issue**: Auto-linking fails
- Check contact creation logs
- Verify project_contacts policy
- Ensure issue_steps update succeeds

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can disable features:
1. **Disable auto-emails**: Comment out email sending in `FieldIssues.jsx` line 327-358
2. **Disable invitations**: Remove invite route from `App.jsx`
3. **Rollback database**: Drop invitations table and email columns

---

## Success Metrics

### KPIs to Track
1. **Invitation sent**: Number of invitations created
2. **Acceptance rate**: % of invitations accepted
3. **Time to accept**: Average time from send to accept
4. **Email delivery rate**: % successfully delivered
5. **External contact engagement**: Tasks assigned to non-users

### Expected Results
- 60-80% invitation acceptance rate
- <24 hours average time to accept
- 95%+ email delivery rate
- 20-30% of tasks assigned to external contacts
